## About Me

I am persuing my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology Karnataka,Surathkal.

## My Projects

### Implementation of MADPIE Algorithm in ns-3

MADPIE is an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism developed to address the bufferbloat problem. Read more at [here](https://github.com/bijaydev/MADPIE).

### Implementation of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in TCP over wireless network in ns-3

This project is a minor modification to the working of ECN and TCP, but provides a significant improvement in the performance of TCP over wireless network. Read more at [here](https://github.com/bijaydev/Implementation-of-Explicit-congestion-notification-ECN-in-TCP-over-wireless-network-in-ns-3).

### Diabetes Risk among Women

This project aims to find relationship between various health indicators and the risk of onset of Diabetes Mellitus in Women. A logistic regression classifier model was developed with accuracy 86%. Read more at [here](https://github.com/bijaydev/Diabetes-Risk-among-Women).

### An Energy Aware Reliable And Robust Routing Protocol For Wireless Sensor Network

This paper proposes an energy aware reliable and robust routing protocol (EA3RP) which finds an efficient forwarding path between source and destination node using a heuristic function.This paper was presented in _International Conference on Trends in Research,Engineering & Developmental Sciences, Kerala, India, June 16-17, 2016_.
